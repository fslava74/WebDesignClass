Live now; make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. What makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You remove those obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ …Message, Spock?” “…None that I am conscious of — save, perhaps, for ‘Happy Birthday.‘

Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose -- and excluding that which is painful. Human beings do not survive on bread alone ... but on the nourishments of liberty. For what indeed is a man without freedom ... naught but a mechanism, trapped in the cogwheels of eternity. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior -- mentally or otherwise. Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing.

I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing. Madness has no purpose. Or reason. But it may have a goal. They used to say that if Man was meant to fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently. Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. He tasks me. He tasks me; and I shall have him. I’ll chase him ’round the moons of Nibia and ’round the Antares maelstrom and ’round Perdition’s flames before I give him up. Do you know the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold? It is very cold — in space. It’s a — far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before; a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known.” “…Is that a poem?” “…Mmm. Something Spock was trying to tell me — on my birthday.

Compassion: that's the one things no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. The intellect is not all... but its cultivation must come first, or the individual makes errors... wastes time in unprofitable pursuits. One man cannot summon the future. But one man can change the present!  A lie is a very poor way to say hello. Look at these three words written larger than all the rest, and with special pride never written before or since -- tall words, proudly saying "We the people" ... these words and the words that follow ... must apply to everyone or they mean nothing. Khaaannnn! You’ve never really faced death, have you?” “...No; not like this. I haven’t faced death. I’ve cheated death. I’ve tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity; I know nothing.

A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. A library serves no purpose unless someone is using it. Leave bigotry in your quarters; there's no room for it on the bridge. Change is the essential process of all existence. Now, I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love, when every day is a struggle to survive. But I do insist that you do survive, because the days and the years ahead are worth living for!  …Warp speed.
